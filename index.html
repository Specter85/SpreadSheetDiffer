    <h1>Spreadsheet Differ</h1>
	
	<p>The Excel-based Spreadsheet Differ is a tool for finding the differences between 
	two spreadsheet files. It requires a copy of Microsoft Excel to work. It outputs a 
	.csv file that contains on each row what cell changed, what the old value was, and 
	what the new value is. .xlsx, .xls, and .csv file formats are supported.</p>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>

	<p>The program requires .net 4.5 to be installed on the computer. .net 4.5 can be found 
	here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">http://www.microsoft.com/net/</a></p>

	
	<ol>
	<li>Click the top Browse button to select your first spreadsheet, then choose a worksheet 
	of that spreadsheet (.xls, .csv, and .xlsx formats only).</li>
	<li>Click the second Browse button to select your second spreadsheet, then choose a 
	worksheet of that spreadsheet (.xls, .csv, and .xlsx only).</li>
	<li>Click the bottom Browse button to select or create your destination file.</li>
	<li>Click Diff!</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Known issues</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Closing any Excel windows while the Differ is running will cause the program to 
		crash. If you do close an Excel window, you will have to open a new instance of the 
		Excel-based Spreadsheet Differ.</li>
		<li>If two diffed spreadsheets have more than 1,048,576 cells different, the output 
		.csv file will not be fully viewable in Excel - a program such as Notepad++ is 
		recommended in shuch a case.</li>
		<li>This program was not designed to run on a distributed system, and any damages 
		caused by doing so are solely the responsibility of the user.</li>
